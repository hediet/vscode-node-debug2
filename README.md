# Node Debug With Pause Events

This is a fork of [vscode-node-debug2](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-node-debug2) and provides the `node-debug2-with-pause-events` and `extensionHost-with-pause-event` debug adapters.
They are like `node-debug2` and `extensionHost`, but send a custom pause event when the debugger pauses.

This is required for my Debug Visualizer Extension.
